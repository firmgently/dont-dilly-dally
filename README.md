# Don't Dilly Dally

# ** This app is in a wobbly state at the moment while I convert it from vanilla JS to TypeScript **

dontdillydally is a simple timesheet app for freelancers like me who want to keep track of hours worked, earnings coming in and expenses going out.

The main concept is based around items which can be either work or earnings related.

For example, a work item will consist of:
+ amount of time spent
+ for which person
+ at which client/company

A money item will consist of:
+ a monetary amount
+ a sign (positive or negative). Positive is earnings, negative is outgoings.
